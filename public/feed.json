You can find that [here](https://gist.github.com/seanbecker15/49a20ef17e77682d7907f5eba8fd507b).\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere are lots of things that make ChatGPT great under the hood, but let's face it: most people will never truly understand the internals.\nThat doesn't mean that the entire stack has to be a mystery!\n\n### Why UX is important\n\nIf you've ever used the OpenAI API you'll know that it's quite slow to use the standard API without streaming. It can take 10+ seconds to a receive\na response depending on the complexity of the prompt. Although it is [probably a myth](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/n66d0r/comment/gx5b2gl) that users will leave your website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load,\nit is still super important to have good _perceived performance_. For companies working on cutting edge innovation such as OpenAI it is even more important to prove that their tool is useful.\nWaiting for 10+ seconds leads to loss of context and a bad user experience.\n\nThough the total response time is likely the same, the streaming API sends back partial responses as they are generated.\nUsers can see the response in real time and process the response as it is being generated. This makes a huge difference in the user experience.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- I'm using React for this example, but most of this code should be very easy to plug into other frameworks.\n- I'm assuming that you already have a backend endpoint that forwards the OpenAI stream to your frontend. If not, I will be making a guide on how to do that soon.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n```bash\nnpm install eventsource-parser\n```\n\n## Let's get coding\n\n1. Scaffold our component. We'll need a prompt input, a submit button, and a location for our results.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, ChangeEvent } from \"react\";\n\n// Assumes that you can already fetch a completion from OpenAI\nimport { fetchCompletion } from \"./api\";\n\nconst Chatbot = () => {\n  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState(\"\");\n  const [completion, setCompletion] = useState(\"\");\n\n  const handleResponse = async (response: Response) => {};\n\n  const handleChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setPrompt(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  const handleSubmit = () => fetchCompletion(prompt)\n    .then(handleResponse)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <input type=\"text\" value={prompt} onChange={handleChange} />\n        <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>\n      </div>\n      <p>{completion}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n2. Convert OpenAI stream to ReadableStream. OpenAI sends a stream of bytes. We need to convert that to a stream of strings.\n\n```javascript\n...\n\nconst Chatbot = () => {\n  ...\n\n  const handleResponse = async (response: Response) => {\n    const stream = response.body;\n    const textStream = stream.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream());\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n3. Make ReadableStream async iterable. ReadableStream is not yet an async iterable in browsers, so we need to convert it to one.\n   If our target platform were NodeJS we wouldn't need this step as ReadableStream is already an async iterable in NodeJS.\n\n```javascript\n  ...\n\n  // Convert the stream to an async iterator.\n  // Found here https://jakearchibald.com/2017/async-iterators-and-generators/#making-streams-iterate\n  async function* streamAsyncIterator(stream: ReadableStream) {\n    const reader = stream.getReader();\n    try {\n      while (true) {\n        const { done, value } = await reader.read();\n        if (done) return;\n        yield value;\n      }\n    } finally {\n      reader.releaseLock();\n    }\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n  const Chatbot = () => {\n    ...\n\n    const handleResponse = async (response: Response) => {\n      const stream = response.body;\n      const textStream = stream.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream());\n      const asyncIteratorStream = streamAsyncIterator(textStream);\n      for await (const chunk of asyncIteratorStream) {\n        console.log(chunk);\n      }\n    }\n\n    ...\n  }\n```\n\n4. Previously we were logging each chunk to the console. Now we need to parse each chunk as an event. We'll use the `eventsource-parser` package to do this.\n\n```javascript\n...\n\nimport { createParser, ParsedEvent, ReconnectInterval } from \"eventsource-parser\";\n\n...\n\nconst Chatbot = () => {\n  ...\n\n  const parseEvent = (event: ParsedEvent | ReconnectInterval) => {\n    console.log(event);\n  };\n\n  const handleResponse = async (response: Response) => {\n    ...\n    const parser = createParser(parseEvent);\n    for await (const chunk of asyncIteratorStream) {\n      parser.feed(chunk);\n    }\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\n```\n\n5. Update completion text as we get each event. You should now see the completion text update as it is generated.\n\n```javascript\n...\n\nconst Chatbot = () => {\n  ...\n\n  const parseEvent = (event: ParsedEvent | ReconnectInterval) => {\n    if (event.type !== 'event' || event.data === '[DONE]') {\n      return\n    }\n\n    const delta = JSON.parse(event.data).choices[0]?.delta?.content || \"\";\n    setCompletion((prev) => {\n      if (prev) {\n        return prev + delta;\n      } else {\n        return delta;\n      }\n    });\n  };\n\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Recap\n\nThat's it! You should now have a working chatbot that can complete sentences in real time. You can find the full code [here](https://gist.github.com/seanbecker15/49a20ef17e77682d7907f5eba8fd507b).\n",

      "content_html": "\nAfter reading [Dan Abramov’s post](https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/) about the AT Protocol, I became curious about how identity works on Bluesky. Using [atproto-browser.vercel.app](https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/), I realized how simple it is to connect your own domain to your account. My profile now lives at **at://seanbecker.me**.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Find your DID\n\nGo to [https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/](https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/) and look up your existing Bluesky handle, in my case `seanbex.bsky.social`.\nMy DID is:\n\n```\ndid:plc:p2epzw3sltq7tdsg7sn7qenr\n```\n\n### 2. Add the `.well-known` verification file\n\nOn your website, create a file at:\n\n```\nhttps://seanbecker.me/.well-known/atproto-did\n```\n\nThe file should contain only your DID:\n\n```\ndid:plc:p2epzw3sltq7tdsg7sn7qenr\n```\n\nMake sure there are no extra spaces or newlines.\n\n### 3. Update your handle in Bluesky\n\nIn the Bluesky app or on the web:\n\n- Go to **Settings → Change handle**\n- Select **I have my own domain**\n- Enter `seanbecker.me`\n\nBluesky will check the `.well-known` file and update your handle once verified.\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nThe AT Protocol makes it possible to manage your online identity under your own domain, independent of any specific platform. It’s a small change that makes the web feel a little more open again.\n\nThanks to [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io) for the inspiration to explore this.\n",
