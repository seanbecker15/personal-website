But let's face it, most people (myself included) will never truly understand the internals.\nBut that doesn't mean that the entire stack is a mystery.\n\n## Why is this interface important?\n\nIf you've ever used the OpenAI API, you know that it's a bit slow without using the streaming API. It can take 10+ seconds to a receive\na response depending on the complexity of the prompt. Though the idea that users will leave your website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load is [probably a myth](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/n66d0r/comment/gx5b2gl),\nit is still very important to have good _perceived_ performance. Waiting for 10+ seconds leads to loss of context and a bad user experience.\n\nThough the total response time is likely the same, the streaming API sends back partial responses as they are generated.\nUsers can see the response in real time and process the response as it is being generated. This makes a huge difference in the user experience.\n\n## Let's get started\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- I'm using React for this example, but most of this code should be very easy to drop into other frameworks.\n- I'm assuming that you already have a backend forwarding the OpenAI stream to your frontend. If not, I will be making a guide on how to do that soon.\n{/* TODO */}\n- Just looking for code? You can find that [here]().\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n```bash\nnpm install eventsource-parser\n```\n\n### Code\n\n\n1. Create a component with form submission\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { useState, ChangeEvent } from \"react\";\n\n  // Assuming that you have a function that fetches the completion from the OpenAI API\n  import { fetchCompletion } from \"./api\";\n\n  const Chatbot = () => {\n    const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState(\"\");\n    const [completion, setCompletion] = useState(\"\");\n\n    const handleResponse = (response: Response) => {};\n\n    const handleChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n      setPrompt(e.target.value);\n    };\n\n    const handleSubmit = fetchCompletion(prompt).then(handleResponse)\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <input type=\"text\" value={text} onChange={handleChange} />\n        <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>\n        <p>{completion}</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n  ```\n\n1. Convert stream to async iterable ReadableStream\n\n  ```javascript\n    // Convert the stream to an async iterator.\n    // Found here https://jakearchibald.com/2017/async-iterators-and-generators/#making-streams-iterate\n    async function* streamAsyncIterator(stream: ReadableStream) {\n      const reader = stream.getReader();\n      try {\n        while (true) {\n          const { done, value } = await reader.read();\n          if (done) return;\n          yield value;\n        }\n      } finally {\n        reader.releaseLock();\n      }\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    const Chatbot = () => {\n      ...\n\n      const handleResponse = (response: Response) => {\n        const stream = response.body;\n        const asyncIteratorStream = streamAsyncIterator(stream);\n        for await (const chunk of asyncIteratorStream) {\n          console.log(chunk);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ```\n\n1. Use eventsource-parser to parse the SSE stream\n\n  ```javascript\n\n  const Chatbot = () => {\n    ...\n\n    const parseEvent = (event: ParsedEvent | ReconnectInterval) => {\n      console.log(event);\n    };\n\n    const handleResponse = (response: Response) => {\n      ...\n      const parser = createParser(parseEvent);\n      for await (const chunk of asyncIteratorStream) {\n        parser.feed(chunk);\n      }\n    }\n\n    ...\n  }\n  \n  ```\n\n1. Update completion text as we get each event\n\n  ```javascript\n  const Chatbot = () => {\n    ...\n\n    const parseEvent = (event: ParsedEvent | ReconnectInterval) => {\n      if (event.type !== 'event' || event.data === '[DONE]') {\n        return\n      }\n\n      const delta = JSON.parse(event.data).choices[0]?.delta?.content || \"\";\n      setCompletion((prev) => {\n        if (prev) {\n          return prev + delta;\n        } else {\n          return delta;\n        }\n      });\n    };\n\n    ...\n  }\n  ```",
