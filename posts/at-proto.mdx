After reading [Dan Abramov’s post](https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/) about the AT Protocol, I became curious about how identity works on Bluesky. Using [atproto-browser.vercel.app](https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/), I realized how simple it is to connect your own domain to your account. My profile now lives at **at://seanbecker.me**.

## Steps

### 1. Find your DID

Go to [https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/](https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/) and look up your existing Bluesky handle, in my case `seanbex.bsky.social`.
My DID is:

```
did:plc:p2epzw3sltq7tdsg7sn7qenr
```

### 2. Add the `.well-known` verification file

On your website, create a file at:

```
https://seanbecker.me/.well-known/atproto-did
```

The file should contain only your DID:

```
did:plc:p2epzw3sltq7tdsg7sn7qenr
```

Make sure there are no extra spaces or newlines.

### 3. Update your handle in Bluesky

In the Bluesky app or on the web:

- Go to **Settings → Change handle**
- Select **I have my own domain**
- Enter `seanbecker.me`

Bluesky will check the `.well-known` file and update your handle once verified.

## Closing thoughts

The AT Protocol makes it possible to manage your online identity under your own domain, independent of any specific platform. It’s a small change that makes the web feel a little more open again.

Thanks to [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io) for the inspiration to explore this.
